Patient is semi-reliable historian.\n\ufeff\nHPI: The pt is a man who presents with 5 days of dysarthria in the setting of hypertensive urgency, nausea/vomiting. Per transfer summary, he came in with abd craming, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and inability to tolerate PO food or medications. His blood sugar was in the 600s and BP 200/80s. He was given IV fluids and his blood sugars were stabilized. He did not have evidence of DKA at that time. He was admitted for evaluation, and had some coffee-ground emesis for which he had endoscopy and was found to have gastritis.\n\ufeff\nOn HD 2 the patient noted that since just prior to his prenoius situation his speech has been different. He says that he is unable to speak at a normal rate and that his speech is no longer \"very good.\" He says that he has difficulty both with coming up with words and with saying them. He says that while he wears dentures occasionally, he is usually able to speak well without them, but now is not able to. He cannot name specific example of his speech difficulty. Per transfer note, he confirmed the change in his speech. He says he has never had difficulty speaking prior to this episode.\n\ufeff\nHe also notes that from around the time when he began to have difficulty speaking his L hand has felt more numb and clumsy than usual. He normally walks holding a cane in his L hand, but has had trouble holding the cane.\n\ufeff\nSBP goal was lowered to 140 and arrangements were made to have patient transferred to for close monitoring and further workup/treatment.\n \nOn general review of systems, the pt complaines of cough, nausea, vomiting/retching. No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. No recent change in bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.\n",
