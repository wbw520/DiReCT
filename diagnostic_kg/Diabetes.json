", "Type II Diabetes": "Type 2 diabetes is often associated with insulin resistance and may involve testing for  Insulin levels and C-peptide levels: The diagnosis of type II diabetes should be determined according to the curve shape of the values of C-peptide release test and insulin release test in different states,for example,fasting,30min,60min,120min,180min. Able-bodied person:fasting basic plasma insulin is 5-20mlU/L,OGTT reached the peak value after 10min,and insulin returns to the basic level after 180 min;fasting C-peptide level was 1.1-4.4ng/ml,the secretion reached the peak which reaches 5-6 times of the basic value. Pre-diabetic patients:often in early stage type II diabetes, insulin levels may be normal or high. Classic type II diabetes:fasting insulin levels are normal or  above the  normal range.the peak is delayed after oral glucose,may reach the peak at 120min,but did not fall to the normal levels at 180min;fasting C-peptide level can be normal,high or low,the release curve rises slowly after taking sugar,the peak is delayed,and the release curve still does not fall back to the fasting level after 180 min. C-peptide testing can help evaluate the function of pancreatic beta cells and their ability to produce insulin.", "Specific Types of Diabetes": "Due to other conditions", "Gestational Diabetes Mellitus": "Diagnosed during pregnancy through glucose testing strategies that may include the OGTT"}}
