Motor or sensory impairment: In the central nervous system distribution area.\n; etc."}, "Multiple Sclerosis": "MRI: MRI is one of the most important tools for diagnosing MS, showing areas of damage (called lesions or plaques) in the brain and spinal cord. MRI can detect damage to myelin, a key feature of MS.\nCSF Analysis: A sample of cerebrospinal fluid is obtained through a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and analyzed for the presence of immune system activity, which is common in people with MS. CSF analysis may show abnormal immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and oligoclonal bands, which are hallmarks of MS.    \nVisual Evoked Potentials, VEPs: In people with MS, visual pathways may have conduction delays due to damage to myelin sheaths\n             ", "Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis": "Clinical Presentation: At least two clinical attacks, each with symptoms indicating involvement of different central nervous system (CNS) areas. The condition has distinct attacks (relapses) and remission periods. During an attack, symptoms suddenly worsen, followed by a remission phase in which symptoms partially or completely subside and the condition remains stable without significant progression.\nMRI:Presence of at least two distinct lesions in different CNS locations consistent with demyelination. Utilization of weighted imaging and contrast enhancement to demonstrate the presence and evolution of new and old lesions.\nCerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):Detection of oligoclonal bands (OCB) or elevated IgG index (value above 0.7).", "Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis": "Clinical Presentation: Disease progression from onset without distinct relapses.\nDisease Duration: Progression for at least 1 year.\nMRI:Presence of at least two T2-weighted lesions in the brain and/or spinal cord.\nCerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):Detection of oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG index (value above 0.7).", "Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis": "Clinical Presentation: Initially presents as RRMS, later transitioning to sustained worsening of disease with or without new relapses.\nDisease Duration: Progression to SPMS at least 3 years after RRMS diagnosis.\nMRI:Continued increase in the number of CNS lesions.\nCerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):Confirmation of persistent oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG index.", "Benign Multiple Sclerosis": " Clinical Presentation: After 10 years, maintains good function with minimal disability (EDSS score \u2264 3).\nLong-Term Observation: Approximately 55% of patients maintain low disability status over the next 10 years.\nMRI:May show fewer CNS lesions, with slow lesion progression.\n"}}
