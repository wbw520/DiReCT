On X-ray or CT images, inflammation appears as localized shadows or infiltrative lesions.\n;Microbiological tests: Identification of the causative pathogen can be confirmed through microbial cultures and PCR tests of body fluids such as sputum, blood, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\n;Complete blood count (CBC): An increased white blood cell count in the CBC is commonly associated with infection but is not a specific indicator.\n;Blood gas analysis: For patients with severe pneumonia, blood gas analysis can help assess oxygenation and acid-base balance.\n;C-reactive protein and other inflammatory markers: Levels of these markers typically rise during infections, but they also lack specificity.\n", "Bacterial Pneumonia": "Detection of specific bacteria by PCR or other molecular biology methods. Or suppuration caused by bacteria", "Viral Pneumonia": "PCR technology detects the genetic material of a specific virus"}}
