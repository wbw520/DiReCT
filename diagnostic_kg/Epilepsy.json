Central Nervous System Infections: Meningitis, encephalitis; etc.", "Symptoms": "Patients with epilepsy may experience seizures that vary in frequency from several weeks to several months apart. Some may have seizures more likely to occur under specific conditions, such as lack of sleep, high stress, or exposure to intense light.; etc.", "Signs": "Before, mood changes, unusual sensations (such as strange tastes or sounds), fear, or gastrointestinal discomfort.
