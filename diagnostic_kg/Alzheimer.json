{"diagnostic": {"Suspected Alzheimer": {"Alzheimer": []}}, "knowledge": {"Suspected Alzheimer": {"Risk Factors": "Age; genetic factors; gender; cardiovascular health; head trauma; intellectual activity; lifestyle and diet; other diseases such as diabetes, depression, and sleep disorders.; etc.", "Symptoms": "Cognitive decline, including memory loss and deterioration of other functions; impairment in at least two cognitive areas; progressive decline in memory and cognition without loss of consciousness; typically occurs between ages 40 and 90, with higher frequency after 65; absence of other systemic or brain diseases to explain the decline; specific cognitive functions may deteriorate, such as language, motor skills, and perception; difficulty in daily activities and changes in behavior; family history of similar disorders, especially if confirmed by neuropathology; additional symptoms may include depression, insomnia, incontinence, delusions, hallucinations, outbursts, sexual disorders, and weight loss; some patients may exhibit neurological abnormalities like increased muscle tone, myoclonus, or gait disturbances; seizures may occur in advanced stages.  ; etc."}, "Alzheimer": "1. Clinical Assessment\n    Detailed medical history and neuropsychological tests: Evaluate the patient's cognitive functions, including memory, attention, language abilities, executive functions, and visuospatial skills.\n    Neuropsychological assessment tools: Such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).\n;2. Imaging Studies\n    Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Used to check for structural changes in the brain, particularly atrophy in the hippocampus and other memory-related areas.\n    Positron Emission Tomography (PET):\n        FDG-PET: Assesses brain metabolic activity; patients with Alzheimer's disease typically show reduced glucose metabolism in the temporal-parietal lobes.\n        Amyloid PET: Detects amyloid-beta deposits in the brain, a significant biomarker of Alzheimer's disease.\n;3. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Biomarkers\n    Amyloid-beta 42 (A\u03b242): In patients with Alzheimer's, the level of A\u03b242 in the CSF is typically reduced.\n    Total tau and phosphorylated tau proteins: Levels of these markers are usually elevated in the CSF of patients with Alzheimer's.\n;4. Genetic Testing\n    APOE \u03b54 allele: This is one of the most significant genetic markers known to be associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.\n"}}
