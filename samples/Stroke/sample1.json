Patient is semi-reliable historian.\n\ufeff\nThe patient is a male who presents with a 5-day history of dysarthria in the context of hypertensive urgency, nausea, and vomiting. According to the transfer summary, he initially presented with abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and an inability to tolerate oral intake or medications. His blood glucose levels were in the 600s and his blood pressure was 200/80s. He was administered IV fluids, and his blood glucose levels were stabilized. There was no evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at that time. He was admitted for further evaluation and experienced some coffee-ground emesis, for which an endoscopy was performed, revealing gastritis.\n\ufeff\nOn the 2nd hospital day, the patient noted that since just prior to his previous situation, his speech has been different. He says that he is unable to speak at a normal rate and that his speech is no longer \"very good.\" He reports having difficulty both with finding words and with saying them. Although he occasionally wears dentures, he is usually able to speak well without them, but now he cannot. He cannot provide specific examples of his speech difficulty. According to the transfer note, he confirmed the change in his speech. He states that he has never had difficulty speaking prior to this episode. He also notes that around the time his speech difficulty began, his left hand has felt more numb and clumsy than usual. He normally walks using a cane in his left hand but has had trouble holding the cane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
