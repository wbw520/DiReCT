However, when asked about it today, she mentioned that the pain was related to her cough. She described the pain as a substernal soreness and noted that she has recently started coughing up blood-tinged sputum. (She typically has a productive cough due to her asthma.) Earlier today, she was sent to the emergency department after her oxygen saturation levels dropped at her PCP's office. She denied experiencing syncope, lightheadedness, or palpitations. At baseline, she has two-pillow orthopnea but no history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND). Additionally, she reports recent nausea but denies any abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n",
